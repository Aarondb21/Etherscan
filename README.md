# Etherscan
How do I send ether from etherscan to my wallet?
I have bought 50 ethers and i have sended it to ether.li but to the wrong address. And now it's standing on etherscan. I have sended etherscan and etherli. Etherli is not responding and etherscan sends me to etherli. 
DOES SOMEONE KNOW HOW I CAN SEND MY 50 ETHERS TO MY WALLET ??? Or can i do something else with it on etherscan? Because now it's just standing there and i'm nothing with it! 

Thnx!!!
